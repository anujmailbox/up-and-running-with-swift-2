# [Up and Running With Swift 2][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Swift is a new programming language from Apple, designed specifically for creating iOS, OS X and watchOS apps. The designers of Swift drew from the best of the new generation of languages, while also building on the success of C and Objective-C. Swift has a powerful type system for safe programming and adds many features to make the lives of programmers easier. Even though it's barely a year old, Swift is already popular with programmers for its flexibility and expressiveness.

In this course, Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen will start from the foundations to give you a thorough understanding of the Swift language. The course will introduce Swift's types, control flow and object-orientation syntax, with a special emphasis on the features that make Swift unique. This course will also highlight some of the great new features that have come to Swift in version 2.
